# Task-Todo-API
The purposee of this project is to create a simple H2 API which documents a users daily/weekly tasks.

# Introduction
OOP-based java api, with utilisation of supporting  technologies, that encapsulates all fundamental and practical modules covered during the QA Digital Skills Bootcamp.

# Scope 
<p>●	Code fully integrated into a Version Control System using the feature-branch model: main/dev/multiple features.</p>
<p>●	A project management board with full expansion on user stories, acceptance criteria and tasks needed to complete the project.</p>
<p>●	A risk assessment which outlines the issues and risks faced during the project timeframe.</p>
<p>●	A relational database, locally or within the Cloud, which is used to persist data for the project. </p>
<p>●	A functional application ‘back-end’, written in a suitable framework of the language covered in training (Java/Spring Boot), which meets the requirements set on your Scrum Kanban board.</p>
<p>●	A build (.jar) of your application, including any dependencies it might need, produced using an integrated build tool (Maven).</p>
<p>●	A series of API calls designed with postman, used for CRUD functionality. (Create, Read, Update, Delete)</p>
<p>●	Fully designed test suites for the application you are creating, including both unit and integration tests.</p>

# Getting it Running

These instruction will help you get a running version of this API on your machine.

# What You'll Need

H2,
Java (version 11.0 or higher),
Apache Maven,
Git

# Installing

After you have installed all the necessary software, download the latest release from the releases tab.

Once you have the .jar file downloaded make sure to navigate with your command line interface to the folder it is stored in.

In the Command Line interface run

Todo-Task-Api.jar

# Problems

I have included a Mysql application properties file, but the test H2 file is default. This is because MySql will not run properly on my setup. IntelliJ and MySQL will not talk to each other on my system.

This problem with MySQL took up up a significant amount of time. As you can see from my Initial concept documentation in the Documentation folder; originally I wanted to create a front end which users could interact with. In the future I would like to add a frontend.

# Testing 

Unit test: 80%
